The most recent development of _aa_ has been presented on the [INCF Assembly 2021](https://neuroinformatics.incf.org).

### Automatic Analysis for more efficient and reproducible M/EEG pipelines ###

aa has been developed with an initial focus on MRI, including integration with the SPM toolbox. The recent integration of the highly popular EEGLAB and FieldTrip toolboxes further extends aaâ€™s functionalities to the M/EEG community. EEGLAB offers an exceptional array of tools for pre-processing M/EEG data and FieldTrip excels in analysing various features of the data at both sensor and source levels. An example workflow is also provided based on the openly available MPI Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset, which can cover many common electrophysiological use cases.
